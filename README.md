# Basicranial-Sexual-Dimorphism
MPhil Thesis Code:
This repository contains the necessary code to replicate the landmark-based three-dimensional Geometric Morphometrics (GMM) pipeline and statistical analyses used in the MPhil Thesis: Basicranial Sexual Dimorphism in modern _Homo sapiens_. 

All code was performed in R studio and MorphoJ using data collected from the New Mexico Decedent Imaging Database (NMDID) - A large repository of post-mortem full body CT data of known biological sex and age: https://nmdid.unm.edu/

It will allow the user to do the following: 
Generalised Procrustes Analysis (GPA),
Principle Components Analysis (PCA),
Procrustes ANOVA,
Bootstrapped Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), 
Production of virtual endocasts - to calculate Endocranial Volume (ECV) (via __Endomaker_), (Profico, _et al.,_2020)
Allometry analysis - PC1-PC2 vs ECV/CS,
Thin Plate Spline (TPS) warped deformation models,
Wireframes of positive and negative PCs superimposed by Male and Female landmark configurations,
Specific landmark configurations: 
FM area, length, and breadth and their allometric scaling relationships with cadaver stature, cadaver weight, and ECV.
